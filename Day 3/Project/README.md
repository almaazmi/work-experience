# Day 3 Project: Asteroid Defender

This folder contains all the files for the Day 3 graphical asteroid shooter game project.

## Files in this Folder

- `asteroid_defender_turtle_starter.py`: Starter code for the Turtle Graphics implementation
- `asteroid_defender_pygame_starter.py`: Starter code for the PyGame implementation

- `Asteroid Defender Solution/`: This folder contains the complete solution implementation, including:
  - `asteroid_defender.py`: The full working game
  - `README.md`: Documentation on how the solution works

## Getting Started

1. Choose which implementation you want to work with:
   - Turtle Graphics: Simpler, using Python's built-in turtle module
   - PyGame: More advanced, with better performance for games

2. Open the corresponding starter file in your editor
3. Follow the instructions and comments in the file to implement the game features
4. If you get stuck, refer to the solution for guidance

## Project Requirements

Build a graphical asteroid shooter game where the player controls a spaceship and destroys incoming asteroids. Your game should include:

1. Player-controlled spaceship with keyboard controls
2. Randomly generated asteroids
3. Collision detection between bullets, ship, and asteroids
4. Score tracking and display
5. Game states (start screen, gameplay, game over)
6. Sound effects (optional)

## Testing Your Game

Run your game from the terminal:

For Turtle Graphics version:
```
python asteroid_defender_turtle_starter.py
```

For PyGame version:
```
python asteroid_defender_pygame_starter.py
```

## If You Need Help

If you get stuck, you can:
1. Check the hints in the starter code
2. Look at the solution code for guidance
3. Refer to the relevant chapters in the Resources folder
