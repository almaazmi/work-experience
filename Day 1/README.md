# Day 1: Game Basics - Applying Python Fundamentals (Chapters 1-5)

## Overview
Welcome to Day 1 of your Python game development work experience! Today, we'll focus on building a simple game using the fundamental Python concepts from Chapters 1-5 of the Python Space Adventure book. All necessary resources from these chapters are available in the Resources folder for your reference.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use Python basics in a practical game development context
- Apply variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops to create game logic
- Build a working space-themed game that demonstrates these concepts

## Morning Session: Introduction and Setup
- Introduction to Python programming and game development
- Review of Python fundamentals from Chapters 1-5:
  - Variables and data types (Chapter 2)
  - Operators and expressions (Chapter 3)
  - Conditional statements (if/elif/else) (Chapter 4)
  - Loops (while and for loops) (Chapter 5)

## Afternoon Session: Building a Text-Based Space Adventure Game
You'll create a text-based space adventure game that demonstrates your understanding of Python fundamentals. The game will feature:

- A character navigating through a spaceship
- Inventory management using variables and lists
- Decision points using conditional statements
- Game loops for repeated actions
- Oxygen management system using operations

## Project Details: "Space Explorer: The Text Adventure"
Your game will put the player in the role of an astronaut who must explore a damaged spaceship, collect supplies, and complete missions. The player will interact with the game through text commands and make decisions that affect the outcome.

### Key Features to Implement:
1. Character stats (oxygen level, health, etc.)
2. Inventory system (limited items can be carried)
3. Multiple locations to explore
4. Random events using conditional logic
5. Win/lose conditions

### Project Files
All project files are in the Project folder:
- `space_explorer_starter.py` - Use this as your starting point
- `Space Explorer Solution/` - Contains the complete solution for reference

## Resources
- Sample code from Chapters 1-5
- Code templates to help you get started
- Reference guide for common Python syntax
- Challenge problems to extend your game

## End of Day Deliverable
By the end of today, you'll have a working text-based space adventure game that demonstrates your understanding of Python fundamentals. You'll present your game to the group and explain how you applied the concepts you learned.

## Preparation for Day 2
For tomorrow, we'll expand on what you've built today by adding more advanced features using functions, user input, and file handling (Chapters 6-10).
