# Creating a GitHub Account

GitHub is a platform that hosts code repositories and allows developers to collaborate on projects. Let's set up your GitHub account.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a GitHub account, ensure you have:
- A working internet connection
- A valid email address
- [Git installed](intro-to-git-commands.md#installing-git) on your computer (you'll need this to use GitHub effectively)

## Steps to Create a GitHub Account

1. **Visit GitHub's Website**
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click on "Sign up" in the top-right corner

2. **Enter Your Information**
   - Enter your email address
   - Create a password
   - Choose a username (this will be visible to others)
   - Complete the verification puzzle
   - Click "Create account"

3. **Verify Your Email**
   - Check your email for a verification message from GitHub
   - Click the verification link in the email

4. **Set Up Your Profile**
   - Add a profile picture (optional but recommended)
   - Fill in your name
   - Add a short bio (optional)
   - You can add other information like your location and website if you wish

## Personalizing Your GitHub Account

### Profile README
You can create a special repository to showcase information on your profile:

1. Create a new repository with the same name as your GitHub username
2. Add a README.md file to this repository
3. The content of this README will appear on your profile page

### Setting Up SSH Keys (Optional but Recommended)

SSH keys provide a secure way to connect to GitHub without entering your password each time.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Generate an SSH key pair by running:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
3. When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location
4. Enter a secure passphrase (or press Enter for no passphrase)
5. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy the contents of your public key (typically found at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`)
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste your key and give it a descriptive title

## Next Steps

Now that you have a GitHub account, proceed to the [Introduction to Git Commands](intro-to-git-commands.md) to learn how to use Git with your new GitHub account.
