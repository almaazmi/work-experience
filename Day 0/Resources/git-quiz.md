## Answers

1. B) A distributed version control system
2. B) Adds changes to the staging area
3. B) A database of file changes
4. B) A snapshot of changes at a specific point in time
5. B) To work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase
6. B) A hosting service for Git repositories
7. C) A proposal to merge changes from one branch to another
8. C) Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository
9. B) To specify files that Git should ignore
10. A) When two branches can't be merged due to incompatible changes
11. False
12. False
13. True
14. False
15. False
16. 'git pull' fetches changes from a remote repository AND merges them into your current branch. 'git fetch' only downloads the changes without merging them.
17. The 'git status' command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area, including which files are tracked, modified, or untracked.
18. Basic Git workflow: modify files → git add (stage changes) → git commit (save changes) → git push (share changes)
19. A merge creates a new commit that combines changes from different branches, preserving the branch history. A rebase reapplies your branch's commits on top of another branch, creating a linear history.
20. Use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' to undo the last commit while keeping the changes in your working directory.
