# Day 2: Intermediate Game - Building with Functions & Files (Chapters 6-10)

## Overview
Welcome to Day 2 of your Python game development work experience! Today, we'll build upon yesterday's foundation and create a more sophisticated game using concepts from Chapters 6-10 of the Python Space Adventure book. All necessary resources from these chapters are available in the Resources folder for your reference.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use functions to organize and reuse code
- Apply program arguments and user input for more interactive games
- Implement collections and file handling to save game state
- Build a game with persistent data and more complex interactions

## Morning Session: Review and Advanced Concepts
- Review of Day 1 project and concepts
- Introduction to intermediate Python concepts:
  - Functions and parameters (Chapter 6)
  - Program arguments (Chapter 7)
  - User input handling (Chapter 8)
  - Collections - lists, dictionaries, tuples (Chapter 9)
  - File handling for saving game state (Chapter 10)

## Afternoon Session: Building a Space Resource Management Game
You'll create a resource management game set in space where the player must balance resources, explore new areas, and complete missions. The game will incorporate:

- Functions for game mechanics
- User input for commands and decisions
- Collections to store game objects and state
- File handling to save and load game progress

## Project Details: "Cosmic Commander: Resource Management"
Your game will put the player in charge of a space station or colony that must gather resources, manage systems, and survive in the harsh environment of space.

### Key Features to Implement:
1. Resource tracking system (oxygen, food, energy, materials)
2. Mission system with functions for different mission types
3. Save/load game functionality using file operations
4. User input command system
5. Inventory management using collections
6. Random events that affect resources

## Resources
- Sample code from Chapters 6-10
- Function templates for common game mechanics
- Guide to file operations for game saves
- Examples of data structures for game objects

## End of Day Deliverable
By the end of today, you'll have a functional resource management game that demonstrates your understanding of intermediate Python concepts. The game should be able to save and load game state and provide a more complex user experience than Day 1's project.

## Preparation for Day 3
For tomorrow, we'll take a big leap forward by creating a graphical game using Turtle Graphics and PyGame (Chapters 11-12). Be prepared to see your code come to life with visual elements!
